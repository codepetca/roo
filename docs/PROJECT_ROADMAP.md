# Project Roadmap - High-Level Overview

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**For detailed implementation plans**, see `docs/development/detailed-roadmap.md`

## **Project Goal** üéØ

Enable teachers using restricted school accounts to easily export Google Classroom data to this webapp for AI-powered grading. Teachers log in with personal Gmail accounts, link school emails, and import classroom data to Firestore. Students access results through secure authentication.

## **Current Status** (~75% Complete)

### ‚úÖ **Fully Implemented & Working**
- **Teacher Onboarding**: OAuth-based Google Sheet creation with automatic service account permissions
- **AppScript Integration**: Automated data extraction from Google Forms to personal sheets via board account
- **Firebase Backend**: Secure webhook-based sync from AppScript to Firestore with comprehensive API
- **AI Grading**: Gemini 1.5 Flash integration with generous grading for programming assignments
- **Teacher Authentication**: Google OAuth with personal Gmail accounts, school email linking
- **DataConnect-Ready Architecture**: Normalized entities with versioning and audit trails
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Zod validation and shared type system across all boundaries
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 90+ tests covering services, schemas, and business logic

### üöß **In Development** 
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Basic interface exists, needs complete submission management and grading UI
- **Student Authentication**: Email passcode system implemented, needs onboarding workflow completion
- **Student Portal**: Basic dashboard structure exists, needs grade display and feedback features

### ‚ùå **Critical Missing Components**
- **Student Onboarding Flow**: No mechanism for teachers to invite students or distribute access credentials
- **Email Integration**: Passcode distribution system not connected to email service
- **Complete Student Access**: Students can't discover/register for the system independently

## Development Principles

### **Quality Gates** (ALL MUST PASS)
- **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all new features
- **Type Safety First**: No `any` types, comprehensive Zod validation at all boundaries
- **Schema-First Design**: API contracts drive development decisions
- **Quality Checks**: Tests + linting + type checking + build must pass before commits

### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Student Access First**: Complete the missing student onboarding/portal (highest impact)
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Build on existing solid foundation, avoid rewrites
3. **Production Focus**: Prioritize reliability and user experience over advanced features
4. **Email Integration**: Critical missing piece for student access workflow

- **Student Dashboard**: `frontend/src/routes/dashboard/student/+page.svelte` - Basic structure exists
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Core functionality present, extend with student management
- **Email Templates**: Need to create reusable templates for passcode distribution

### **New Components to Build**
- **Email Service**: Firebase Function integration with SendGrid/AWS SES
- **Student Invitation Workflow**: Teacher-initiated bulk invitation system
- **Registration Landing**: Token-based student registration with classroom linking
- **Roster Import**: CSV/Google Classroom integration for student lists
