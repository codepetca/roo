# Project Roadmap - High-Level Overview

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**For detailed implementation plans**, see `docs/development/detailed-roadmap.md`

## Current Status

### âœ… **Fully Implemented & Working**
- **Teacher Onboarding**: OAuth-based Google Sheet creation with automatic permissions
- **AppScript Integration**: Daily automated data extraction from Google Forms to personal sheets
- **Firebase Backend**: Secure webhook-based sync from AppScript to Firestore
- **AI Grading**: Gemini 1.5 Flash with generous grading for programming assignments
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Zod validation and shared type system across all boundaries
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 90+ tests covering services, schemas, and business logic

### ðŸš§ **In Development**
- **Teacher Frontend**: Basic dashboard exists, needs submission summaries and manual grading UI
- **Student Frontend**: Authentication implemented, needs grade/feedback display
- **Production Scheduling**: AppScript nightly automation needs formal scheduling setup

### ðŸ“‹ **Planned Development**
- **Complete Teacher Dashboard**: Full student management and grading interface
- **Complete Student Portal**: Grade viewing with detailed AI feedback
- **Enhanced Automation**: Robust nightly processing with error recovery

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Complete Teacher Frontend** (Current Priority)
**Goal**: Full-featured teacher dashboard for managing students and grading  
**Key Components**:
- Student submission summaries and status tracking
- Manual AI grading interface with grade override capabilities
- Analytics dashboard with class performance metrics
- Complete classroom workflow management

### **Phase 2: Complete Student Frontend** (Next Priority)
**Goal**: Student portal for viewing grades and AI feedback  
**Key Components**:
- Grade viewing with detailed AI feedback display
- Progress tracking and assignment history
- Interactive feedback features and grade appeals
- Student authentication and course access

### **Phase 3: Production Hardening** (Future)
**Goal**: Robust production-ready automation  
**Key Components**:
- Reliable nightly AppScript scheduling with fallbacks
- Advanced student management (dropped/transferred handling)
- Performance optimization and comprehensive monitoring
- Multi-teacher support and scalability improvements

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features** (Long-term Vision)
**Goal**: Enhanced capabilities and institutional integration  
**Key Components**:
- Document submission grading (Google Docs/Sheets)
- Rubric-based assessment and plagiarism detection
- Learning analytics and advanced insights
- School information system integrations

## System Architecture Overview

### **Data Flow**
```
Board Forms â†’ Personal Google Sheets â†’ AppScript (nightly) â†’ Firebase â†’ Frontend View
```

### **Key Technologies**
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + Svelte 5 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions + TypeScript + Zod validation
- **Database**: Firestore (primary) + Google Sheets (data source)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash with generous grading
- **AppScript**: Essential for teacher data collection and nightly sync

### **Current Capabilities**
- **Teacher Onboarding**: Automated OAuth sheet creation with service account permissions
- **Data Sync**: Secure webhook-based synchronization from AppScript to Firebase
- **AI Grading**: Generous programming assignment grading with detailed feedback
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Zod schemas at all system boundaries
- **Testing**: 90+ tests ensuring system reliability and correctness

## Development Principles

### **Quality Gates**
- **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all new features
- **Type Safety First**: No `any` types, comprehensive Zod validation
- **Schema-First Design**: API boundaries drive development decisions
- **Quality Checks**: All tests + linting + type checking must pass before commits

### **Current Focus Areas**
1. **Teacher Dashboard Completion**: Full submission management and grading interface
2. **Student Portal Development**: Grade viewing and feedback display
3. **Production Scheduling**: Reliable nightly AppScript automation
4. **System Monitoring**: Error recovery and performance optimization
