## Documentation Philosophy

This project uses a **three-tier documentation strategy**:

### Tier 1: Core Principles (`../CLAUDE.md`)
- Fundamental, rarely-changing guidance
- Technology stack and essential patterns
- Updated only when core architecture changes

### Tier 2: Living Documentation (`docs/development/`)
- Detailed, evolving guidance that changes with the project
- Current architecture, implementation patterns, collaboration guides
- Updated as patterns emerge and evolve

### Tier 3: Session Context
- Real-time guidance provided in development sessions
- Immediate feedback and course corrections
- Not documented but communicated directly

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Documentation

**Always Update**:
- Adding new major features ‚Üí Update `current-architecture.md`
- Establishing new patterns ‚Üí Update `coding-patterns.md`
- Changing core technology ‚Üí Update `../CLAUDE.md`
- Completing roadmap phases ‚Üí Update `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`

**Regular Reviews**:
- Monthly architecture review
- Before major releases
- When onboarding new team members
- After completing major refactoring

### How to Keep Documentation Current

1. **Link Changes to Documentation**: When making significant code changes, include documentation updates in the same PR
2. **Use Living Documents**: Most documents in `development/` are marked as "Living" - update them as the system evolves
3. **Validate Consistency**: Regularly check that documentation matches actual implementation
4. **Archive Outdated Information**: Remove obsolete patterns and mark deprecated approaches

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case: `current-architecture.md`
- Include purpose in name: `ai-collaboration-guide.md`
- Date major revisions: `roadmap-2025-q1.md` (if needed)

### Content Structure
- **Status indicators**: Living Document, Last Updated, etc.
- **Clear headings**: Use semantic markdown structure
- **Code examples**: Include actual code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- **Update triggers**: Explain when to update the document

### Cross-References
- Link to related documents
- Reference specific sections when helpful
- Maintain bidirectional links where appropriate
