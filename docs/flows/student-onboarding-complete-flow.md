# 📚 Complete Student Onboarding & Access Flow

**Status**: 🚧 In Development (System 75% complete)  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  

This document describes the complete end-to-end flow for student onboarding, authentication, and access to grades in the Roo system.

## 📋 **Overview**

Students access the system through a teacher-initiated process that:
1. Teachers invite students by email (bulk or individual)
2. Students receive secure passcode via email
3. Students register and authenticate via passcode
4. Students access their personalized grade dashboard
5. Teachers can manage student access and monitor engagement

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Teacher-Initiated Student Invitations**

### **Step 1: Roster Management Interface**
**Location**: `/dashboard/teacher/students/` (TO BE BUILT)

```javascript
// Teacher workflow:
1. Access student management dashboard
2. Import roster (CSV upload or manual entry)
3. Review student list and email addresses  
4. Generate bulk invitations with classroom linking
5. Track invitation status and responses
```

### **Step 2: Invitation Generation System**
**Location**: `functions/src/routes/student-invitations.ts` (TO BE BUILT)

```javascript
// Process flow:
1. Validate teacher permissions for classroom
2. Generate unique invitation tokens for each student
3. Create student records in Firestore (pending status)
4. Queue email invitations for batch sending
5. Track invitation delivery and click-through rates
```

### **Critical Components to Build:**
- **Invitation Tokens**: Secure, time-limited tokens linking students to classrooms
- **Email Queue System**: Batch processing for large roster invitations
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitor email delivery, opens, and click-through rates
- **Roster Import**: CSV parsing and validation for bulk student additions

## 🔄 **Phase 2: Student Registration & Authentication**

### **Step 1: Registration Landing Page**
**Location**: `/students/join/{invitationToken}` (TO BE BUILT)

```javascript
// Student experience:
1. Click invitation link from email
2. Validate invitation token and classroom association
3. Enter email address (pre-filled from invitation)
4. Request passcode for authentication
5. Complete registration and profile setup
```

### **Step 2: Enhanced Passcode System**
**Location**: `functions/src/routes/auth/passcode.ts` (EXISTS - NEEDS EMAIL INTEGRATION)

```javascript
// Current system needs enhancement:
1. ✅ Generate 6-digit passcode (implemented)
2. ✅ Store in Firestore with expiration (implemented)  
3. ❌ Email delivery via SendGrid/AWS SES (TO BE BUILT)
4. ✅ Passcode verification and user creation (implemented)
5. ❌ Classroom association during registration (TO BE BUILT)
```

### **Step 3: Email Service Integration**
**Location**: `functions/src/services/email-service.ts` (TO BE BUILT)

```javascript
// Email service responsibilities:
1. Template management for different email types
2. SendGrid/AWS SES integration for delivery
3. Delivery tracking and bounce handling
4. Rate limiting and queue management
5. Personalization with student/teacher context
```

## 🚀 **Phase 3: Student Grade Access & Portal**

### **Step 1: Enhanced Student Dashboard**
**Location**: `frontend/src/routes/dashboard/student/+page.svelte` (EXISTS - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT)

```javascript
// Current capabilities:
✅ Basic grade display with statistics
✅ Assignment list with completion status
✅ Grade filtering and sorting
✅ Responsive layout with TailwindCSS

// Enhancements needed:
❌ Detailed AI feedback display
❌ Assignment progress tracking
❌ Grade history and trends
❌ Mobile optimization
❌ Student-teacher communication features
```

### **Step 2: Grade History & Feedback**
**Location**: `/dashboard/student/grades/` (EXISTS - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT)

```javascript
// Enhanced grade viewing:
1. Assignment timeline with submission dates
2. Detailed AI feedback with rubric breakdown  
3. Grade trend analysis and progress tracking
4. Comparison with class averages (anonymized)
5. Grade inquiry/appeal submission system
```

### **Step 3: Student-Teacher Communication**
**Location**: `/dashboard/student/feedback/` (TO BE BUILT)

```javascript
// Communication features:
1. Grade inquiry submission with assignment context
2. Teacher response tracking and notifications
3. Assignment clarification requests
4. Progress check-ins and goal setting
5. Grade appeal process with audit trail
```

## 🔐 **Security & Authentication Architecture**

### **Token-Based Security**
- **Invitation Tokens**: JWT with classroom and student email claims
- **Expiration Policy**: 7-day expiration for invitation tokens
- **Single-Use**: Tokens invalidated after successful registration
- **Classroom Binding**: Tokens tied to specific classroom IDs

### **Student Authentication Flow**
```javascript
// Complete authentication sequence:
1. Invitation Token Validation → Classroom Association
2. Email Passcode Generation → Secure 6-digit code
3. Passcode Verification → Firebase Auth user creation  
4. Role Assignment → Student role with classroom permissions
5. Profile Creation → Student record with enrollment data
```

### **Permission Model**
- **Student Access**: Limited to own grades and assigned classrooms
- **Teacher Oversight**: Can reset student auth and view access logs
- **Data Isolation**: Students cannot access other students' data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all authentication events
