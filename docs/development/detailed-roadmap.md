## Technical Architecture

### **Current System Flow:**
```
Board Forms â†’ Personal Google Sheets â†’ AppScript (nightly) â†’ Firebase â†’ Frontend View
```

**Data Flow Details:**
1. **Teachers collect data** via Google Forms in classroom folders  
2. **AppScript runs nightly** in board account to consolidate form data
3. **Webhook syncs data** to Firebase with API authentication
4. **AI processes submissions** using Gemini 1.5 Flash
5. **Grades stored in Firestore** for frontend display (no write-back to sheets)

### **Core Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + Svelte 5 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions + TypeScript + Zod validation  
- **Database**: Firestore (primary) + Google Sheets (data source)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash with generous grading
- **Testing**: Vitest with 90+ comprehensive tests
- **AppScript**: Essential for teacher data collection and nightly sync

### **Key Services:**
- **Teacher Onboarding**: OAuth sheet creation with automatic permissions
- **Classroom Sync**: Webhook-based data synchronization 
- **AI Grading**: Generous mode for programming assignments
- **Student Management**: Firestore-based roster tracking
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Zod schemas at all boundaries

## Development Principles & Lessons Learned

### **Type Safety & Testing**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 90+ tests ensure stability across all services
- **Schema-First Development**: Zod validation at every boundary prevents runtime errors
- **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle maintains code quality
- **Quality Gates**: All tests + linting + type checking must pass before commits

### **AI Grading Success Factors**
- **Generous Grading**: AI successfully gives partial credit for correct logic with syntax errors
- **Context Understanding**: Gemini 1.5 Flash handles handwritten code and programming concepts well
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts balance accuracy with educational kindness

### **Google Sheets Integration**
- **AppScript Reliability**: Daily automation handles form data extraction consistently
- **Permission Management**: Automatic sharing with service accounts eliminates manual setup
- **Data Validation**: Robust parsing handles various Google Form response formats
- **One-Way Flow**: Clean separation between data collection (sheets) and display (app)

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Firebase-First**: Firestore as primary database with sheets as data source
- **Webhook Security**: API key authentication protects sync endpoints
- **Environment-Aware**: Proper timestamp handling for emulator vs production
- **Svelte 5 Runes**: Modern reactive patterns improve frontend performance

## Quality Assurance

### **Pre-Deployment Checklist**
- âœ… All tests pass: `npm run test`
- âœ… Quality check: `npm run quality:check` 
- âœ… Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- âœ… Type safety verified: No `any` types
- âœ… Schema validation: All boundaries use Zod

### **Production Monitoring**
- **Firebase Logs**: Monitor function execution and errors
- **Webhook Health**: Track sync success/failure rates
- **AI Service**: Monitor Gemini API usage and rate limits
- **Performance**: Track grading processing times

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Development Issues**
- **Permission Errors**: Verify service account access to sheets
- **Webhook Failures**: Check API key authentication and payload format
- **Type Compilation**: Run `npm run build` after TypeScript changes
- **Test Failures**: Use `npm run emulators` for consistent test environment

### **Production Issues**
- **AppScript Errors**: Check board account permissions and trigger scheduling
- **Grading Failures**: Monitor Gemini API rate limits and error responses
- **Sync Problems**: Verify sheet data format matches expected schemas
- **Frontend Errors**: Check Firestore security rules and authentication
