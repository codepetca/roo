# üéì Phase 2: Enhanced Teacher Experience

**Goal**: Complete advanced teacher grading and management workflow  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (after Phase 1 completion)  
**Prerequisites**: Complete student access system from Phase 1

This document outlines Phase 2 development priorities focusing on advanced teacher capabilities that leverage the student access infrastructure built in Phase 1.

## üìã **Phase 2 Overview**

### **Why Phase 2 Comes After Student Access**
- **Foundation First**: Student portal validates the complete data pipeline
- **User Feedback**: Phase 1 provides real usage data to inform teacher feature priorities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Core value delivery (student grade access) established before advanced features
- **Resource Optimization**: Teacher advanced features require understanding of actual usage patterns

### **Phase 2 Value Proposition**
- **Advanced Grading**: Manual override, bulk operations, custom rubrics
- **Classroom Analytics**: Performance trends, engagement metrics, learning insights
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamlined grading processes, automated notifications
- **Scale Management**: Support for multiple classrooms, large student populations
