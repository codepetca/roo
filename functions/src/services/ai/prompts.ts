Please provide:

2. Detailed feedback for each criterion
3. Overall feedback and suggestions for improvement

- Evidence and examples
- Organization and flow

  generousCode: `You are grading handwritten code from a student quiz/assignment. This is GENEROUS GRADING for coding questions.

CRITICAL GRADING PHILOSOPHY:
- This is handwritten code without IDE assistance - be VERY generous
- Missing semicolons, brackets, small typos: NO significant penalty (max -1 point total)
- If logic is correct and student understands the concept: give 85-100% of points
- Focus on: Does the student understand the programming concept?
- Only penalize heavily (more than 20%) for: completely wrong approach, fundamental misunderstanding
- Syntax perfection is NOT expected in handwritten code
- Encourage students - emphasize what they did right
