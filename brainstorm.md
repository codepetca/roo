that was a conversation to work out how to implement an automated system alongside google classroom. i'm wondering if i should just start fresh in a new project using firebase. i think i will.

Edit
That's a smart decision! Starting fresh with Firebase will give you a clean foundation and let you implement all those great ideas we discussed without any legacy constraints.

Based on your conversation, you've already worked out a solid architecture:

Core System Components:

Firebase for backend (Firestore + Functions)
Gemini free tier for AI grading (15 requests/min, perfect for your needs)
Apps Script for Google Classroom integration
Email+passcode auth (bypasses school restrictions)
Automated attendance tracking via document changes
Key Benefits of Starting Fresh: ✅ No migration complexity - build it right from the start ✅ Modern Firebase architecture from day one ✅ Clean codebase optimized for your specific workflow ✅ Can implement the automated grading system immediately ✅ Perfect time to set up proper cost monitoring

Your Next Steps:

Create new Firebase project
Set up the core functions (grading, attendance tracking)
Build the dual dashboard system (teacher admin + student results)
Integrate with Google Classroom via Apps Script
Deploy and test with real assignments
The conversation shows you've thought through all the edge cases and have a clear implementation plan. Starting fresh means you can build exactly what you need without any compromises.

Want to begin with setting up the new Firebase project, or would you prefer to start with a specific component like the AI grading functions?
