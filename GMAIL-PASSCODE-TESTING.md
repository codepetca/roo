# Gmail Passcode System - Complete Testing Guide

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

The Gmail-based passcode authentication system has been fully implemented to bypass school email filtering issues.

### 🔧 **What's Been Built:**

1. **`StudentPasscodeAuth.svelte`** - New student login component with passcode flow
2. **`StudentPasscodeSender.svelte`** - Teacher interface to send passcodes via Gmail  
3. **Updated login page** - Now uses passcode system instead of Firebase password reset
4. **Teacher dashboard integration** - Added to Student Management section
5. **Manual testing capability** - Teachers can send to any email address

## 🧪 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Prerequisites:**
✅ Gmail API enabled in Google Cloud Console  
✅ Development server running (`npm run dev`)  
✅ Firebase emulators running  

### **Step 1: Teacher Setup**
1. **Navigate to teacher dashboard**: http://localhost:5173/dashboard/teacher
2. **Sign in as teacher**: Use `dev.codepet@gmail.com`
3. **Grant Gmail permissions**: When prompted, allow Gmail.send scope
4. **Verify access**: Should see "Student Management" section with "Send Student Login Code"

### **Step 2: Send Test Passcode**
1. **Go to Student Management section** on teacher dashboard
2. **Use quick test button**: Click `stewart.chan@gapps.yrdsb.ca` to populate email
3. **Click "Send Login Code"**: This will send passcode via teacher's Gmail
4. **Check for success**: Should see green success message with send confirmation
5. **Development mode**: Passcode should be displayed for easy testing

### **Step 3: Test Student Login**
1. **Navigate to login**: http://localhost:5173/login
2. **Select "Student"**: Notice new text "Login code from teacher"
3. **Enter student email**: `stewart.chan@gapps.yrdsb.ca`
4. **Click "Request Login Code"**: Should show error (correct - students can't self-request)
5. **Enter passcode manually**: Use the code from teacher dashboard (development mode)
6. **Complete login**: Should authenticate successfully

### **Step 4: Verify Email Delivery (Real Gmail)**
1. **Check Gmail account**: `stewart.chan@gapps.yrdsb.ca` inbox
2. **Look for email**: From `dev.codepet@gmail.com` with "Your Roo Login Code"
3. **Verify HTML template**: Professional email with 6-digit code
4. **Test real flow**: Use actual email code instead of development display

## 🔑 **Expected Results:**

### ✅ **Teacher Experience:**
- Teacher can sign into dashboard with Google OAuth
- Gmail permissions granted and stored in Firestore
- Can send passcodes to any email address via Gmail
- Professional HTML email sent from teacher's Gmail account

### ✅ **Student Experience:**  
- New passcode-based login (no more password fields)
- Cannot self-request codes (teacher-managed system)
- Receives login code from teacher's Gmail (bypasses school filters)
- Simple 6-digit code entry for authentication

### ✅ **System Benefits:**
- **Bypasses school email filtering** - uses teacher's Gmail
- **Teacher-controlled access** - no student self-registration  
- **Secure** - 6-digit codes with 10-minute expiration
- **Professional** - HTML email templates
- **Reliable** - no Firebase email delivery issues

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

- **"Gmail access required"** - Teacher needs to sign in with Google OAuth
- **"Teacher authentication required"** - Need to be signed in as teacher
- **No email received** - Check Gmail spam/promotions folder
- **Development mode** - Passcode shown in UI for easy testing

## 🔗 **Test URLs:**
- **Teacher Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173/dashboard/teacher  
- **Student Login**: http://localhost:5173/login
