- Review authentication and authorization
- Check for exposed secrets or credentials
- Audit data handling and validation
- Review dependency security
- Ensure HTTPS and secure communication

## Security Focus Areas for Roo

- Firebase security rules
- Authentication token handling
- API endpoint security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Firestore security rules
- Google Sheets access controls
- Service account key protection

## Specific Security Checks

- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Proper Firebase Admin SDK usage
- Secure cookie handling
- CORS configuration
- Input validation with Zod
- Error message information leakage
- Rate limiting implementation

## Approach

Focus on defensive security practices and threat mitigation.
